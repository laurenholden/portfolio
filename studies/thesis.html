          <p>Hi there, I'm Lauren. I am an <a href="#">interdisciplinary creative</a> <img src="../images/beauty.jpg"> with a passion for words. Drawing on training from the York University/Sheridan College joint program in design (completion: Fall 2017), as well as a lifelong passion for all things literary, my work largely operates at the intersection of typography, graphic design and creative and critical writing. I emphasize research and exploration in everything I do, thrive on variety, and am always eager to learn new things.</p>

          <p>A little about me: Last winter, I spent a semester studying abroad at the Bauhaus University in Weimar, Germany. I am presently helping to develop my graduation showcase as the head of Experiential Design. I am also working on an in-depth research paper on Canadian graphic designer Sam Smart, under the supervision of Canadian Design Historian Brian Donnelley. If I had to choose, I’d say I’m most interested in social justice, poetry and curatorship. I am seeking opportunities beginning in May of 2016.</p> 

          <p>Okay, your turn! I’d love to hear from you at info@laurenholden.ca</p>
